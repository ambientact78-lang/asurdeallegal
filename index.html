          <li><strong>Address / location description</strong> you provide for service or inspection.</li>
          <li><strong>Basic profile info</strong> (such as name or contact details) if you choose to provide it.</li>

          <li>
            <strong>Precise location (when in use)</strong> may be collected if you grant permission,
            so we can route assistance to you and help mechanics locate the service destination.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3) Push notification data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you opt in to notifications, we may collect a <strong>push notification token</strong>
